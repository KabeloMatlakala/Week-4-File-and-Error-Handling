# File Read & Write Challenge üñãÔ∏è

This project is a Python-based file read and write challenge that allows you to read, modify, and write content from one file to another. You can choose from several modification options such as converting text to uppercase, lowercase, reversing the text, or capitalizing each word.

## Features ‚ú®
- Read a file and display its contents.
- Modify the contents of the file with user-selected transformations:
  - Convert text to UPPERCASE
  - Convert text to lowercase
  - Reverse the text
  - Capitalize each word
- Write the modified content to a new output file.
- Error handling for missing files, permission issues, or invalid modifications.

    - Convert text to uppercase  
    - Convert text to lowercase  
    - Reverse text
    - Capitalize each word
      
2. Provide the file path (with full path if necessary) for the input and output files.
   #### Example Flow
     ```
       üîÑ What would you like to do?
        1. Read a file

        3. Exit
        Enter your choice (1/2/3): 2
        
        Enter the input filename: C:\\Documents\\PLP\\python-week-4\\input.txt
        
        Choose a modification:
        1. Convert to UPPERCASE
        2. Convert to lowercase
        3. Reverse text
